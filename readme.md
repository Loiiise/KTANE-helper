# KTANE-helper
A Hookbloom project: helper tool for Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes. This game features several puzzles and a manual on how to solve them. This tool automates the manual, focusing on minimal user input so solving time can be improved.

# Instructions
Currently we're still refactoring the input and output systems. Once the relevant issues have been solved we will add elaborate instructions on how to use the program. For now: feel free to look around the code.

# Rights
We do not own the game or any commercial rights. This is a hobby project meant for private use only.
